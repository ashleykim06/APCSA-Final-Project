# APCSA-Final-Project
Tourist Attractions: Tallest Buildings


Project Propsal

Objective:
My goal is to create an interactive map with the tallest buildings in the world

Methodology:
HTML website, Import a photo of the world map with buttons of a location, The buttons will bring the player to an informative website about the building

Expected Outcomes:
The goal is to create at least 10 buttons on the top 10 tallest buildings, Might not reach the 10 buttons, Small errors on the buttonâ€™s location

Outcomes:
50 buttons were placed, The format was not visually pleasing but it was decent
